## ÔøΩ Incident Simulator - Production Failure Training

**File:** `incident_tools/incident_simulator.py`

A comprehensive incident simulation tool for chaos engineering and incident response training. Safely simulate production-like failures to test system resilience and train teams for real emergencies.

### üéØ Simulation Scenarios
- **CPU Spike** - Sustained high CPU load simulation
- **Memory Leak** - Gradual RAM consumption to test memory management
- **Disk Fill** - Rapid disk space exhaustion simulation
- **DNS Failure** - Network resolution issues and DNS blocking
- **Port Exhaustion** - Connection limit testing and port depletion
- **I/O Storm** - Heavy disk read/write activity simulation
- **Network Lag** - Latency and packet loss simulation
- **Process Bomb** - Safe process spawning for resource testing

### ‚ö° Intensity Levels
- **Low** - Minimal impact, suitable for production testing
- **Medium** - Moderate impact, ideal for staging environments
- **High** - Maximum impact, recommended for dedicated test systems only

### üîí Safety Features
- **Auto-cleanup** - Automatic resource cleanup after simulations
- **Time limits** - Built-in duration controls to prevent runaway processes
- **Safe limits** - Reasonable caps on resource consumption
- **Emergency stop** - Immediate termination of all active simulations

### Scenario Examples

**CPU Spike Simulation:**
```bash
incident-sim> start cpu_spike 60 high
STARTING INCIDENT SIMULATION
Scenario: High CPU Usage
Description: Simulates sustained high CPU load

Intensity: HIGH
Simulating high CPU usage for 60 seconds...
Simulation completed!
```

**Memory Leak Simulation:**
```bash
incident-sim> start memory_leak 120 medium
STARTING INCIDENT SIMULATION
Scenario: Memory Leak  
Description: Gradually consumes available RAM
Severity: Critical
Intensity: MEDIUM
Simulating memory leak for 120 seconds...
Allocated: 245 MB
Memory released
```

**I/O Storm Simulation:**
```bash
incident-sim> start io_storm 90 low
STARTING INCIDENT SIMULATION
Scenario: I/O Storm
Description: Creates heavy disk I/O activity
Severity: Medium
Intensity: LOW
Simulating I/O storm for 90 seconds...
I/O Ops - Reads: 156, Writes: 156
```

### API Usage
```python
from incident_simulator import IncidentTool

# Create simulator instance
simulator = IncidentTool()

# Start CPU simulation
result = simulator.StartSim('cpu_spike', duration=60, intensity='medium')

# Check simulation history
history = simulator.sim_history

# Emergency cleanup
simulator.StopAll()
```
